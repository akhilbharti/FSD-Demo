## Getting Started

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the blog post to understand and implement Feature Slice Methodology in your React TypeScript projects.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- Familiarity with React and Redux.

## Project Structure

The code follows a structured approach as discussed in the blog post:
```
my-app/
│
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── store.ts
│   │   └── App.tsx
│   │
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── filters/
│   │   │   ├── FilterBar.tsx
│   │   │   └── filterSlice.ts
│   │   │
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   │   ├── TaskItem.tsx
│   │   │   ├── TaskList.tsx
|   |   |   └── tasksSlice.ts
│   │   │
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── CommonComponent1.tsx
│   │   ├── CommonComponent2.tsx
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── index.tsx
│
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── manifest.json

## Structuring the Application

One of the core principles of Feature Slice Methodology is the structured organization of your application into self-contained feature slices. Each feature slice represents a specific functionality or module within your project. This approach enhances modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

In the example To-Do List application, we apply this methodology by structuring the project as follows:

### `src/features/`

This directory is the heart of our project, containing individual feature slices. Each feature slice is organized in its own directory, following a consistent naming convention. For example:

- `filters/`: Represents one feature slice with its own set of components and logic.
- `tasks/`: Another tasks slice, isolated from the rest of the application.


### Redux Integration

To manage the application's state, we employ Redux, a robust state management library. Each feature slice includes its Redux slice to handle state specific to that feature. This isolates state logic, making it easier to maintain and understand.

The overall project structure follows the Feature Slice Methodology's principles of modularity and separation of concerns. This ensures that as the application grows, it remains organized, scalable, and easy to collaborate on.
